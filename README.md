# Fractal Rendering

This project implements Julia set fractal rendering using HTML5, JavaScript, and Web Workers. It generates fractal images on a `<canvas>` element, with support for interactive zooming and panning.

## Features

- Real-time rendering of Julia set fractals.
- Interactive zoom and pan using the mouse.
- Automatic canvas resizing when the browser window size changes.
- Utilizes Web Workers to parallelize the rendering process for improved performance.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the basic page structure and `<canvas>` element.
- **JavaScript**: For rendering logic and user interaction.
- **Web Workers**: For parallel processing of fractal rendering.

## Setup

### Requirements

- A modern browser with support for HTML5 and Web Workers.

### Running the Project

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Lixomensch/Fractal-Rendering.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd fractal-rendering
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in a browser:

    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```

    Or drag and drop the `index.html` file into a browser window.

## Usage

- **Zoom**: Use the mouse wheel to zoom in or out on the fractal.
- **Pan**: Click and drag to move the view of the fractal.
- **Resizing**: The canvas will automatically resize to fit the browser window when the window size changes.
